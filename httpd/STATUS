CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.4.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur after 2.4.1.  Such changes can
    only be made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.4.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk
    then merge into branches/2.4.x, as applicable.

  * Current exceptions for RTC for this branch:
    . http/2 - mod_http2
    . mod_lua
    . documentation
    . non-Unix build
    . non-Unix, single-platform code

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

     now has CR status (confirming our interpretation) and MS has committed
     to changing their implementation.  PR 53845

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

   * mod_journald: Add new module mod_journald to log error logs into journald.
                   This patch needs changes done in mod_systemd patch (already
                   proposed for 2.4.x).

     +1: jkaluza, jim
     rjung, minfrin: Not understanding "This patch needs changes done in
                     mod_systemd patch", am I right in understanding this patch is
                     already committed?
     jkaluza: No, that patch is not committed yet. It is in STALLED section.
              The link for that patch is: http://people.apache.org/~jkaluza/patches/mod_systemd/httpd-2.4.x-mod_systemd.patch

  *) http: Don't remove the Content-Length of zero from a HEAD response if
     it comes from an origin server, module or script. Allow the previous
     behaviour (for legacy/buggy modules only, not origin) by also backporting
     the HttpContentLengthHeadZero directive (and also HttpExpectStrict which
     comes for free with the same commit).

     +1: ylavic, jim
     ylavic: r1554303 issued a major MMN bump, but since the ABI change is two
             ints added at the end of core_server_config, the proposed merge
             does a minor bump only.
     minfrin: Two new directives need to be documented.

  *) mod_alias: Introduce expression parser support for Alias, ScriptAlias
     and Redirect. Limit Redirect expressions to directory (Location) context
     and redirect statuses (implicit or explicit).

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE BEING WORKED

   * mod_proxy_http: Don't establish or reuse a backend connection before pre-
     fetching the request body, so to minimize the delay between it is supposed
     to be alive and the first bytes sent: this is a best effort to prevent the
     backend from closing because of idle or keepalive timeout in the meantime.
     Also, handle a new "proxy-flushall" environment variable which allows to
     flush any forwarded body data immediately. PR 56541+37920.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/r1656259
                  http://svn.apache.org/r1656359 (CHANGES entry)
     2.4.x patch: trunk works (modulo CHANGES, docs/log-message-tags)
     +1: ylavic
     -0: jim:  This seems to be a hit to normal performance, to handle an
               error and/or non-normal condition. The pre-fetch is
               expensive, and is always done, even before we know that
               the backend is available to rec' it. I understand the
               error described, but is the fix actually worth it (plus
               it seems to allow for a DDoS vector).
     ylavic: It seems to me that the problem is real since we reuse the
             connection before prefetching 16K (either controlled by the
             client, or by an input filter), we currently always prefetch
             these bytes already. Regarding performance I don't see any
             difference (more cycles) compared with the current code.
             However I think I failed to rebuild the header_brigade when
             the proxy loop is retried (ping), so I need to rework this.
             Do you think we'd better remove the prefetch, or maybe just
             make it nonblocking (by default)?
        jim: Non-blocking seems the best way to handle...

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

   * core: Add ap_errorlog_provider to make ErrorLog logging modular. This
           backport keeps syslog logging as part of httpd core and only adds

   * mod_proxy: Add ap_proxy_define_match_worker() and use it for ProxyPassMatch
     and ProxyMatch section to distinguish between normal workers and workers
     with regex substitutions in the name. Implement handling of such workers
     in ap_proxy_get_worker(). Fixes the bug when regex workers were not

     -.8: trawick
          This commit is essentially deciding that an httpd install on
          Windows now has printenv/testcgi written in 2 more languages.
          To the extent that the usefulness is that it shows how to make scripts
          of these types executable by httpd, I believe that the documentation
          is the proper place to solve that.  To the extent that the usefullness
          is to show how to implement a CGI in these particular languages, I believe
          that the httpd distribution and documentation in general is not the
          place for that.  Historically these types of scripts have caused problems
          for downstream vendorsas well as newbies (and sometimes the intersection
          of those two groups) who don't understand that these are information leaks
          once they are enabled, and the subtlety of the way they are disabled ("Apache
          messed up the first line; let me fix that") contributes to that.
     fuankg notes: I've just added a big warning to all CGI scripts which should now
          make absolutely clear that these CGIs are for testing purpose only - so those
          who enable those scripts with inserting the right shebang should be 100% aware
          of any risks (this should cover your last point).
     jim: trawick, does the above address your concerns?
     trawick: to some extent (somebody reading the script gets an idea)
          Why isn't the configuration requirement documented instead
          of described indirectly in a sample?
          Why are these new samples added to the install without three
          votes?  (I didn't veto it; put your name next to the two
          existing ones and I'll be satisified that enough people
          considered this addition as an appropriate solution for a
          real httpd usability problem.)
     wrowe: I'd agree with trawick, and suggest that these scripts can begin
            their life somewhere in the manual/ tree.  This really seems like
            the place where /usr/share/httpd/examples/ would be useful, but
            there isn't an ordinary directory for that.  Since we want none
            of the scripts to function 'out of the box', what about a new
            cgi-examples/ dir alongside cgi-bin/? Otherwise manual/cgi/examples
            might work?
