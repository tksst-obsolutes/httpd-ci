    <summary>
        <p>This module provides HTTP/2 (RFC 7540) support for the Apache
            HTTP Server.</p>
        
        <p>This module relies on <a href="http://nghttp2.org/">libnghttp2</a>
            to provide the core http/2 engine.</p>
        
        <note type="warning"><title>Warning</title>
          <p>This module is experimental. Its behaviors, directives, and 
          defaults are subject to more change from release to 
          release relative to other standard modules. Users are encouraged to 
          consult the "CHANGES" file for potential updates.</p>
        </note>

        <p>You must enable HTTP/2 via <directive
        module="core">Protocols</directive> in order to use the
        functionality described in this document:</p>

            <p>
                This directive toggles the usage of the HTTP/2 Direct Mode. This
                should be used inside a 
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive> 
                section to enable direct HTTP/2 communication for that virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct communication means that if the first bytes received by the 
                server on a connection match the HTTP/2 preamble, the HTTP/2
                protocol is switched to immediately without further negotiation.
                This mode is defined in RFC 7540 for the cleartext (h2c) case. Its
                use on TLS connections not mandated by the standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mode only has an effect when h2 or h2c is enabled via

            <p>
                This directive toggles the usage of the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade method 
                for switching to HTTP/2. This
                should be used inside a 
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive> 
                section to enable Upgrades to HTTP/2 for that virtual host.

            <p>
                This method of switching protocols is defined in HTTP/1.1 and
                uses the "Upgrade" header (thus the name) to announce willingness
                to use another protocol. This may happen on any request of a
                HTTP/1.1 connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method of protocol switching is enabled by default on cleartext
                (http:) connections and disabled on TLS (https:), as mandated
                by RFC 7540.

                This directive sets the size of the window that is used for flow control
                from client to server and limits the amount of data the server has to buffer.
                The client will stop sending on a stream once the limit has been reached until
                the server announces more available space (as it has processed some of the data).

                This limit affects only request bodies, not its meta data such as headers. Also,
                it has no effect on response bodies as the window size for those are managed
                by the clients.

            <p>
                This directive sets maximum number of <em>extra</em> file handles
                a HTTP/2 session is allowed to use. A file handle is counted as
                <em>extra</em> when it is transfered from a h2 worker thread to
                the main HTTP/2 connection handling. This commonly happens when
                serving static files.
            </p><p>
                Depending on the processing model configured on the server, the
                number of connections times number of active streams may exceed
                the number of file handles for the process. On the other hand,
                converting every file into memory bytes early results in too 
                many buffer writes. This option helps to mitigate that.
            </p><p>
                The number of file handles used by a server process is then in

            <p>
                This directive toggles the security checks on HTTP/2 connections
                in TLS mode (https:). This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The security checks require that the TSL protocol is at least
                TLSv1.2 and that none of the ciphers listed in RFC 7540, Appendix A
                is used. These checks will be extended once new security requirements
                come into place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name stems from the 
                <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS">Security/Server Side TLS</a>
                definitions at mozilla where "modern compatiblity" is defined. Mozilla Firefox and
                other browsers require modern compatiblity for HTTP/2 connections. As everything
                in OpSec, this is a moving target and can be expected to evolve in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                One purpose of having these checks in mod_http2 is to enforce this
                security level for all connections, not only those from browsers. The other
                purpose is to prevent the negotiation of HTTP/2 as a protocol should
                the requirements not be met.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the security of the TLS connection is determined by the
                server configuration directives for mod_ssl.

                This directive sets the number of bytes to be sent in small
                TLS records (~1300 bytes) until doing maximum sized writes (16k)
                on https: HTTP/2 connections.
                This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Measurements by <a href="https://www.igvita.com">google performance
                labs</a> show that best performance on TLS connections is reached,
                if initial record sizes stay below the MTU level, to allow a
                complete record to fit into an IP packet.
            </p>
            <p>
                While TCP adjust its flow-control and window sizes, longer TLS
                records can get stuck in queues or get lost and need retransmission.
                This is of course true for all packets. TLS however needs the 
                whole record in order to decrypt it. Any missing bytes at the end
                will stall usage of the received ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a sufficient number of bytes have been send successfully,
                the TCP state of the connection is stable and maximum TLS record
                sizes (16 KB) can be used for optimal performance.

                In deployments where servers are reached locally or over reliable
                connections only, the value might be decreased with 0 disabling
                any warmup phase alltogether.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following example sets the size to zero, effectively disabling
                any warmup phase.

                This directive sets the number of seconds of idle time on a TLS
                connection before the TLS write size falls back to small (~1300 bytes)
                length.
                This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s.

                See <directive type="section">H2TLSWarmUpSize</directive> for a
                description of TLS warmup. H2TLSCoolDownSecs reflects the fact
                that connections may detoriate over time (and TCP flow adjusts)
                for idle connections as well. It is beneficial to overall performance
                to fall back to the pre-warmup phase after a number of seconds that
                no data has been sent. 
            </p>

                In deployments where connections can be considered reliable, this
                timer can be disabled by setting it to 0. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The following example sets the seconds to zero, effectively disabling
                any cooldown. Warmed up TLS connections stay on maximum record
                size.
