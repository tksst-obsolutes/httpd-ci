Instructions for Apache-Test Release Manager

1. 'make dist' - to make sure nothing is missing from the manifest,
   etc. Now test this generated package (not svn) with as many
   configurations as possible on as many platforms as possible.
   Note, in step 3a, removing the "-dev" line changes the package version
   name.  i.e. (1.27-dev to 1.27)

  a. nuke any preinstalled Apache-Test libs and run 'make test'

  b. test that you can 'make install' and then run 'make test' again

  c. test whether we still 100% OK on systems with no LWP:

     % APACHE_TEST_PRETEND_NO_LWP=1 make test

2. once confident that the package is good, upload a release candidate
   to perl.apache.org/~username and post 24 hour-ish candidate alert
   to the various lists

     o test-dev/perl.apache.org
     o test-dev/httpd.apache.org
     o dev perl/apache.org
     o modperl/perl.apache.org

   (or maybe longer to give most people a chance to catch up). no need
   to tag this package

  a. if problems are detected during stage 2, repeat stages 1 and 2.

3. when the package has been reported to be good, prepare a new
   package to be released

  a. edit ./Changes:
     - remove '-dev' 
     - add release date

  b. rerun:
     % perl Makefile.PL
     make sure tag looks right
     % make -n tag

  c. commit Changes
     % svn ci Changes

  d. tag
     % make tag

  e. create the final package
     % make dist

  f. test the final package again at least once

4. Upload the package to CPAN

5. Announce the package

  a. post ... to the modperl, announce lists
  Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache-Test 1.27
     include 
  - MD5 sig (as it comes from CPAN upload announce).
  - the latest Changes

6. Prepare for the next cycle

  a. increment version in lib/Apache/Test.pm

  b. edit ./Changes:
     - start a new item with incremented version + '-dev'

  =item 1.28-dev

  c. bump up version numbers in this file to make it easier to do the
     next release.

   perl -pi -e 's/\.28/.29/g' RELEASE
   perl -pi -e 's/\.27/.28/g' RELEASE

     now reload this file and bump up the last number of the first
     command.

  d. commit Changes
     % svn ci -m "start 1.27-dev cycle" Changes RELEASE lib/Apache/Test.pm
